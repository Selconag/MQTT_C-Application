# MQTT_C# Application

#### This is a project to implement and test functionality of MQTT Brokers with C# implementation. In the next steps I will try to send data to Bewell's own server with an IoT Device such as Raspberry Pi 3 or Arduino Uno Clone or with an ESP32. After connection succesfully established the data that will be sent by the IoT Device will be stored on Influx database.
If you want to do a practice with Influx Database you can visit my Influx Test repo where I fixed a legacy implementation.

### I need more info on how to do that. Where can I find a tutorial?
Don't worry Ä± got you covered. In the link below you can find the tutorial I followed.

### VERY IMPORTANT NOTE: In the video the NuGet Package version you must install is for MQTTNet is 3.1.0 if you install anything below or above that version will fail at runtime. That is happenin because libraries in it had changed in every edition.
Explanations in that video is amazingly simple.

ANOTHER NOTE: When I finish my project I will cover this part in a video for connecting a database and sending data from IOT Device
